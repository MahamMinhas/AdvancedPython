    <p style="color:black; background-color: lightcyan; text-align: center;">The problem of waste generation is as old as the advent of human life. 
        With time there has been evolution in the living pattern of humans and so 
        has in the quantity and quality of waste generation. Earlier, 
        the kind of waste generation was mainly biodegradable but gradually the wastes 
        have been transformed to recalcitrant and toxic. <br>During prehistoric times,
         human lived in a group like nomad and the waste they generated were degraded
          by the scavengers. The waste such as weapons, bones and stone tools
           (non biodegradable) never accumulated to the level to pose problem.
           
           <b>The general method employed for the management and disposal of waste 
           was open dumping.</b> Open dumping is still practised widely as it is 
           easy and cheap method.</p>
